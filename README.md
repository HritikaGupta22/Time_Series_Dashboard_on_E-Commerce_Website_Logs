# Time_Series_Dashboard_on_E-Commerce_Website_Logs

## Methodology
The data for the E-Commerce Website Log was sourced from Kaggle. The dataset was first cleaned by removing spaces and then transformed into line protocol format. This formatted file was processed line-by-line, with each line being read at 8-second intervals and inserted into InfluxDB. A database sample was then created, along with a measurement named "churn." Finally, a dashboard was developed using Grafana.
